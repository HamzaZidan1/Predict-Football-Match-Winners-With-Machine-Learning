## Objective: Developed a machine learning model to predict outcomes of English Premier League football matches based on historical match data.
### Techniques Used:
* Data Scraping and Preparation: Utilised requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape match data from the Premier League website. Employed pandas for extensive data manipulation and preparation.
* Feature Engineering: Created predictive features from raw data, including venue codes, opponent codes, match hour, and day of the week. Implemented rolling averages for performance metrics to enhance predictive accuracy.
* Machine Learning: Trained and evaluated a Random Forest classifier. Improved model performance by integrating advanced feature engineering techniques and retraining with updated data.

### Key Achievements:
* Achieved high predictive accuracy by refining the model with real-time match data and historical performance metrics.
* Developed a robust data pipeline that automates data scraping, cleaning, and feature extraction for ongoing predictive analysis.
* Validated model predictions against actual match outcomes, demonstrating significant predictive precision which can be utilised for betting strategies or team performance analysis.
